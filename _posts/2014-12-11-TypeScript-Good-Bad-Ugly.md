## Introduction ##

This is a tricky one.  There are quite a few things in JavaScript that feel
quite tedious to me when I'm typing them out that TypeScript makes a lot cleaner
with less noise.  On the other hand, once you start adding more type information
in and start working with external modules you'll end up doing things that you
didn't have to do before.  Initial this fells like a negative, but you have to
balance it with all the other productivity gains that are made.

I'm going to provide some examples of where TypeScript really shines and then
some areas of where it feels a little rough and what you can do to smooth things
over a bit.


## Good ##

- classes
- inheritance
- generics
- fat arrow

## Bad ##

- external modules, internal modules, and interfaces

## Ugly ##

- mixins
