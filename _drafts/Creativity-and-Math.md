During my time as a high school teacher I had the opportunity to observe
students stuggling with problem solving both in the math classroom, but also
in the computer lab where I taught programming (among other courses).

When it came to problem solving in math, students where used to being shown how
to solve a particular problem and then ask to solve the same problem with 
different numbers on the test.

I was a new teacher.  I thought if I showed my students how to solve some
problems relating to a particular topic that they would be able to solve other
problems that were also related to the topic.

When I gave them an exam where the problems were a little different from what 
they had seen I was suprised at the result.  They flunked.  They were angry at
me.  They thought I was being unfair because I hadn't shown them how to solve
these problems.

I had been unfair.  But not for the reason they thought I was.

That's when it hit me.  Students in your average North American math class do 
not learn problem solving.  They learn how to regurgitate a set of steps to 
solve a particular problem.  This is a much less useful skill and I think that
many students realize this.

Problem solving is much harder to teach.

## Formula, Substitution ##

The thing with problem solving is that it comes in many shapes an forms.  There's
a continuum from simple tasks such as identification of problem and solution to
something more difficult where neither is known.

Let's look at some examples.

    Problem 1:
        What is the hypotenuse of a triangle whose other sides are 3 and 4 units?

This problem requires some pre-requisite knowledge as do all problems.  A student
must know what a hypotenuse is as well as Pythagoras' theorem.  They must also
identify which values in the question correspond to which parts of the equation
in Pythagoras' theorem.  Once they have that all figured out they can proceed 
with the following calculation:

    hyptoneuse = sqrt(3^2 + 4^2) = 5 [TODO: use KaTeX]

There isn't much to this problem.  It could be made more difficult by changing
which side was the unknown.  This would require some basic algebra to re-organize
the equation after substitution.  Additional information could be added to the
problem so that students have to determine what's relevant and what isn't.

A student with sufficient reading comprehension skills and basic equation 
solving skills can actually solve a relatively large set of problems.

What if there isn't an equation for the problem at hand?

This is where the real adventure begins.

## Searching for... ##

Problem solving when you don't have an equation is more complicated.  There are
lots of strategies that cna help.  Some common strategies used in grade school
are:
 
- looking for a pattern
- drawing a picture

Looking for a pattern is excellent because humans are naturally quite good at
determining patterns and once a pattern has been established a formula can often
be derived.

Drawing is helpful because it can help highlight geometric relationships which 
can be used with formulas for area, perimeter, etc. to help determine an 
expression for the value that we're looking for.

Unforutnately, sometimes these strategies aren't enough.  Sometimes, it's 
unclear what next step we should take to get us closer to our goal.  That brings
us to our next strategy:

- trial and error

This could be something as simple as trying a bunch of random numbers until you
get something that works.  You might even be strategic in how those numbers are
chosen (Newton-Raphson method).

Students seem to be more comfortable using trial and error when it comes to 
guessing a number than they do determining which equation (or combination of 
equations) might be useful in reaching the goal.

I have a hunch that students are still concerned about making a mistake
when calculating or manipulating algebra.  They'd rather memorize which equations
to use for which problems.  This unfortunately, means that they also avoid the
experimentation that comes with trial and error.

They also avoid practicing another very useful strategy: "solve a simpler problem".
Honing this strategy also helps with another useful skill, being able to break
a problem down into a set of chunks.  It's very similar to solving a very simple
problem and incrementally and complexity back in until you can solve the original
problem.

## Free Your Mind ##

I have a hypothesis:  If we relieve students concerns about making mistakes in
calculations and algebra, they will be more will experiment with math.  If we
make it quick and easy to do so they will spend more time practicing higher-order 
problem solving strategies.

There's an excellent example of this being done for computer programming.  Khan
Academy's on-line programming courses make use of a live-editor which allows 
students to update their code and see the changes take place in real time.  It 
also checks for syntax errors and gives instructions on how to fix them. 

This combination of maintaining correct syntax and allow easy modification makes
the experience more enjoyable and promotes experimentation by the student.

I propose that we do something similar for math.
